## Welcome
Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm Hoël, a market operations analyst working on wholesale electricity auctions and energy data analytics. My focus is on spreading knowledge of market rules and drivers to improve stakeholder awareness and increase economic efficiency. I am fascinated by trying to optimize constrained markets, which is why I gravitated towards the electiricty industry. Moving electrons from massive rural generators to load constrained urban centers 

I am skilled in VBA, SQL, Microsoft Excel, ArcGIS, and have some knowledge of Python and R. I also work with various business support platforms including Salesforce, JIRA, and Balsamiq. 

## Pronounciation
If you're wondering, my name is pronounced [oʊ wɛl] - or "oh-well" - two syllables, with a silent H.  
I'm named after the Celtic mythological [King Hoël](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoel), who's name my mom fell in love with while reading the legend of *Tristan and Iseult* shortly before my birth.  
As of 2019, I believe I am still the only Hoël in the United States, and definitely the only Hoël Wiesner in the world.
