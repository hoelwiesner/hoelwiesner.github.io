*For the second year in a row, I want to experiment more with my cooking. I want to try new recipes, use interesting ingredients, and venture down unknown flavorful paths. I want to cook 52 new recipes this year, one new recipe a week on average. Last year I lost count of how far I made it (definitely not to 52), but I still pushed myself more than ever before. One aspect I do regret is not chronicling the recipes I tried. This changes that.*

*I'll look to update this post throughout the year as I cook and bake new recipes.*

1. Ma-yi Shang Shu / "Ants Climbing a Tree"

    From the Szechwan cookbook I received for Christmas alongside a Wok. Easy weeknight dinner easily adaptable with whatever stir fry vegetables you want to add.

2. Yu-xiang qie-zi

    Eggplant dish. Lots of oil makes the eggplant - which I'm not usually a fan of - a lot more enjoyable.

3. [Potato Leek Soup](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/potato-leek-soup.html)

    Made for lunch because I had potatoes to use up. Easy, good, goes well with bread.

4. [Pistachio rasberry tarte](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/potato-leek-soup.html)

    Made this for a small dinner with friends. They liked it, but I found the pistachio filling a bit too dense and chewy. Probably won't make again, though I definitely need to work on my tarte pastry.
