The city of Baltimore holds a distinguished place in my imagination. When I first moved to America, and the names of cities and states were still all new to me, I knew Baltimore as the place my dad had finished his PhD. No matter that 7 year old me didn’t know what graduate school, it sounded important, so Baltimore felt important. 

Then in middle school, we visited and I discovered that Baltimore was one of a select few cities to host a Games Day convention — a weekend devoted to Warhammer, the little plastic soldier wargame that had entirely captured my attention and allowance since the 5th grade. When the possibility of my dad being hired by Johns Hopkins started circulating, I was entirely in the “yes” camp. Warhammer was good, so Baltimore was awesome.

We never made it to Baltimore, heading instead to North Carolina and Duke, but my ill informed love and fascination for the city endured. It only solidified over the next decade, as each visit I made showed me a new, exciting, or fun part of the city, and that ill informed love turned into a somewhat better informed love of Baltimore. I’d been charmed by Charm City. 

Matthew has followed in our dad’s footsteps by attending JHU for his PhD. It’s given me plenty of opportunities to visit him and his little family of Manon, Evelyne, and Claire. Which is exactly what I did this past weekend, with Maman also making the trip up from Durham to join us. And as always, M&M served as fantastic tour guides for a city that too often gets the short end of the stick in the public’s imagination.

I can’t quite describe what draws me about Baltimore without sounding like some terrible sociologist devoid of empathy. But Maman did say I was being too nice, not gritty enough, in my observations, so here goes. What draws me to Baltimore is that constant reminder that the American Dream exists, but very few can realize it, let alone for an enduring period of time. This used to be the richest city in the country, with a thriving harbor, import/export businesses, museums, factories, skyscrappers… Then it wasn’t. The crash came. The wealth disappeared, but the people remained. And now it’s slowly coming back. The Inner Harbor is being revitalized. New towers are going up. Jobs are coming back. But the extreme poverty remains, and for all its best efforts, the city can’t hide the suffering. The freshly paved, beautifully done walkways along the harbor are filled with addicts passed out on the sidewalk, or hallucinating on a bench. A reminder to the city’s nouveau rich that not everyone’s as lucky, that the wealth isn’t benefitting everyone equally, that suffering was here before them, is still there, and will continue on long after. That’s the reality of our boom and bust world, with Baltimore trapped in a cycle of highs and lows. No gate can keep out reality.

A lot of word vomit to say I like the griminess of Baltimore. And I loved exploring the community market under the highway overpass, popping into the Greek orthodox cultural festival, climbing to the top of Federal Hill, and driving, scootering, and walking through the pothole-riddled streets. The company of my two nieces made the weekend all the better.
